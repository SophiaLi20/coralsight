# CoralSight - AI Coral Reef Health Assessment

A desktop-based AI/ML solution for automated coral reef health assessment using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

##  About

CoralSight analyzes coral reef images to classify their health status into four categories:
- **Healthy** - Vibrant, thriving coral
- **Bleached** - Loss of color due to stress
- **Diseased** - Signs of infection
- **Algae-Covered** - Excessive algae growth

##  Features

- ✅ Fully offline processing (no internet required)
- ✅ Pre-trained CNN model for accurate assessment
- ✅ Data privacy - all processing on local machine
- ✅ Simple and intuitive user interface
- ✅ Instant results with confidence scores

##  Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coralsight.git
cd coralsight
```

2. Install dependencies:
